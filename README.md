# Frontend Mentor - Meet landing page



## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is the solution to the challenge. Used HTML and CSS3 to achieve the design. This challenge helped me to apply layout skills. Media Queries were also practiced to make it responsive. 

Applied Desktop First Approach , can also be done by Mobile First Approach. Later, this month I will be using SASS/SCSS to make it more standard. 

The mobile responsiveness is added to the limit of 320px as part of challenge. Responsiveness below 320px will be added later.
